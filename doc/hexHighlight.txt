INTRODUCTION                                                        hexHighlight

This plugin looks for hex codes in format #ffffff or #ffff and toggles 
a highlight in that color.  The default mapping for hexHighlight is <leader><F2>.

INSTALLATION

The recommended method is to use either Pathogen or Vundle plugin managers;
use the GitHub site for that method, or, install the hexHighlight.vim file
directly into your plugin directory.
